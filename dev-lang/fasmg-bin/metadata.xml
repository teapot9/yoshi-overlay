		The flat assembler g (abbreviated to fasmg) is a new assembly engine designed
		as a successor of the one used by flat assembler 1. Instead of having a
		built-in support for x86 instructions, it implements them through additional
		packages and in the same way it can be adapted to assemble for different
		architectures and purposes.
